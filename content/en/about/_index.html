{{% blocks/lead %}}
A community initiative to pilot the Proof-of-Soul consensus mechanism. Only allowing pools into the network that are connected to projects with a soul. 
Having a soul means they tend to give more than they take from their environment. 
Specifically soulful projects find sustainable solutions, work with regenerative design and or Game B mechanics.

<h1 class="text-center">How</h1>
</div>
All 13 projects are Catalyst veterans having experienced at least three funds and most successfully funded not only one proposal.
All 13 projects have been contributing to the Catalyst community by creating open source code, documentation or offering pro bono work. 
Trust outside a trustless ledger has been established also via real life in person meetings. 
Each project can account for the soulfulness of the other. The Ryuuki network and its pools are mission driven and additionally contribute to a shared treasury.

<h1 class="text-center">Treasury</h1>
</div>

A fraction of all pool rewards every third epoch is vaulted into the treasury, it is comprised of one representative from each project.
The treasury's main objective is to keep Ryuuki vital and prosperous, while continuing to support the Catalyst community by finding & fostering sustainable community driven projects that create positive feedback loops - that comply with the Proof-of-Soul consensus.

<h1 class="text-center">What's a Mission Driven Stake Pool?</h1>
</div>
A Mission Driven stake pool is connected to a project or team that itself is mission driven. The Stakepool has soul, so to speak.

  <h3>Well what exactly is mission driven?</h3>
  
We refer to something as mission driven, if the focus of the project is on a clearly defined purpose. Usually that purpose involves open source (or commons) contributions, creation of closed loops systems, ecological sustainability or regeneration and regenerative practices.

  <h3>Some Alchemy.</h3>
What happens if you mix two things together? You receive a third new thing. Hence combining the mission driven aspect with stake pool operation leaves us with a novel kind of entity, that is able to self sufficiently and organically grow & nurture community around a cause.
We can go on further and mix this entity with again something new, like DripDropz and voila never before seen or felt possibilities emerge!

Take a ride with us.
