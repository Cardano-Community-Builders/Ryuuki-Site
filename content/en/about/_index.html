{{% blocks/lead %}}
A community initiative to pilot the Proof-of-Soul consensus mechanism. Only allowing pools into the network that are connected to projects with a soul. 
Having a soul means they tend to give more than they take from their environment. 
Specifically soulful projects find sustainable solutions, work with regenerative design and or Game B mechanics.

<h1 class="text-center">How</h1>
</div>
All 13 projects are Catalyst veterans having experienced at least three funds and most successfully funded not only one proposal.
All 13 projects have been contributing to the Catalyst community by creating open source code, documentation or offering pro bono work. 
Trust outside a trustless ledger has been established also via real life in person meetings. 
Each project can account for the soulfulness of the other.

<h1 class="text-center">Treasury</h1>
</div>

A fraction of all pool rewards every third epoch is vaulted into the treasury, it is comprised of one representative from each project.
The treasury's main objective is to keep Ryuuki vital and prosperous, while continuing to support the Catalyst community by finding & fostering sustainable community driven projects that create positive feedback loops - that comply with the Proof-of-Soul consensus.
