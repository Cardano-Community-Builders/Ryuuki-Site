# What is a Mission Driven Stakepool

A Mission Driven stake pool is connected to a project or team that itself is mission driven. The Stakepool has soul, so to speak.

## Well what exactly is mission driven?

We refer to something as mission driven, if the focus of the project is on a clearly defined purpose. Usually that purpose involves open source (or commons) contributions, creation of closed loops systems, ecological sustainability or regeneration and regenerative practices.

# Some Alchemy.

What happens if you mix two things together? You receive a third new thing. Hence combining the mission driven aspect with stake pool operation leaves us with a novel kind of entity, that is able to self sufficiently and organically grow & nurture community around a cause.
We can go on further and mix this entity with again something new, like DripDropz and voila never before seen or felt possibilities emerge!

Take a ride with us.
